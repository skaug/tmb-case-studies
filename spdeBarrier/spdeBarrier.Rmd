## **Spatial modeling with Matern covariance function and land barriers** 
In this example you learn:

* How to use the SPDE approximation of a Matern spatial random field with land barriers in TMB

We use the approach of 
[Bakka et al. (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306187253_Accounting_for_Physical_Barriers_in_Species_Distribution_Modeling_With_Non-Stationary_Spatial_Random_Effects)
for taking account of land barriers such as islands (see figure). The basic idea to decrease the correlation range parameter "on an island" compared to the correlation range "in the sea".
Informally, we can say that the spatial correlation is not allowed to travel accross an island, but is instead forced to travel around. In practice we reduce the spatial range parameter $\kappa$ in the SPDE approximation by a fixed constant $c<1$ on land (while $c=1$ in the ocean).

Before starting on this example, we recomend to go trough [the case study with standard SPDE-procedure](https://github.com/skaug/tmb-case-studies/tree/barrier/spde).

#### Description of the practical situation
In this case study we apply the fish larvea distribution model providede in
[Bakka et al. (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306187253_Accounting_for_Physical_Barriers_in_Species_Distribution_Modeling_With_Non-Stationary_Spatial_Random_Effects). The number of larvea, $y_i$ caught at location ${\bf s}_i$ is assumed to be distributed as
\begin{align}
y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\eta_i),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\log \eta_i =  X \pmb{\beta} + \delta({\bf s}_i) + \epsilon_i.
\end{align}
Here ${\bf X}$ is a design matrix for the fixed effects, $\pmb{\beta}$ is a vector with the covariate regression coefficients, $\pmb{\delta}$ is a latent spatial field with Matern covariance structure with barrieres, and $\pmb{\epsilon}$ is iid Gaussian distributed term yielding over dispersion relative to the Poisson distribution. It is the spatial effect $\pmb{\delta}$ which is of interest in this case study. Note that we do not use the priors included in [Bakka et al. (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306187253_Accounting_for_Physical_Barriers_in_Species_Distribution_Modeling_With_Non-Stationary_Spatial_Random_Effects). 


See https://haakonbakkagit.github.io/btopic128.html#3_case_study for the same case study with use of R-INLA.

  using namespace density; 
  using namespace Eigen; // Needed for utilisation of sparse matrices

  DATA_STRUCT(spdeMatricesBarrier,spde_b); //Barrier information imported from R-INLA
  DATA_VECTOR(c);      // Scaling factor for kappa: (c_ocean,c_land)

  DATA_MATRIX(X);         //Design matrix for fixed effects
```
* Note the line:  `DATA_STRUCT(spdeMatricesBarrier,spde_b);` With this line we include structures needed to construct the barrier precision matrix.
* Note also the line `DATA_VECTOR(c);`. `c` is a vector were the first element provides the range scaling constant off shore (here 1), and on shore (here 0.2).

  <summary>Read parameters from R</summary>
```c++
  PARAMETER_VECTOR(beta); //Regresion coefficients for intercept and covariates
  PARAMETER(log_tau); //log precision for spatial effect
  PARAMETER(log_kappa); //log spatial scale parameter in spatial effect
  PARAMETER(log_sigma_e); //log standard deviation in iid effect
  PARAMETER_VECTOR(x); //Spatial field at mesh nodes (see "Spatial interpolation" below)

  <summary>Transform some of the parameters. </summary>

  Type sigma_e = exp(log_sigma_e);
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Spatial interpolation</summary>
```c++
  vector<Type> delta = (A*x)/tau;
```
* `x` is the value of the random field at the mesh nodes (see figure),
while `delta` is the value at the observation locations.
* We use `x` as our latent variable, to which the Laplace approximation is applied.
* `A` is a spatial interpolation matrix set up in R-INLA.
* Note in addition that `x` is "unscaled", i.e. its distribution does not depend on the precision paramater `tau`.

  <summary>Extract the precission matrix $Q$ for the GMRF resulting from the SPDE approximation with barriers. </summary>
```c++
  SparseMatrix<Type> Q;
  Q = Q_spde(spdeMatricesBarrier,kappa,c);
```
* Here we calculate the sparse precision matrix which accomondates for that the spatial range is five times shorter on land compared to at sea.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Define the objective function 
  $\text{nll}=-\left(\log P(\text{data}|\pmb{\beta}, \pmb{\delta},\pmb{\epsilon}) + \log P(\pmb{\delta}|\kappa,\tau)+ \log P(\pmb{\epsilon}|\sigma_{\epsilon})\right)$. </summary>
```c++
  Type nll=0; //negative log-likelihood

<details>
  <summary>Add the likelihood contribution from the Markov random field: $P(\pmb{\delta}|\kappa,\tau)$ </summary>
```c++
  nll = GMRF(Q)(x);       
```

* `GMRF()` is part of the `density` namespace in TMB, and hence returns
  the *negative* log density of the multivariate normal density with
  precision matrix $Q$, evaluated at $x$.
* You may be surprised to find `GMRF(Q)(x)` instead of `GMRF(Q)(delta)` here. The reason is that we are working
internally with `x` instead of `delta` as noted above.

  Follow the lines above to fit the model. Plot of spatial effect can e.g. be constructed like this:
  
```r

  latentFieldMAP = rep$par.random[names(rep$par.random)=="x"]/exp(rep$par.fixed[which(names(rep$par.fixed)=="log_tau")])

             cex.lab = 1.1,cex.axis = 1.1, cex.main=1, cex.sub= 1.1)
  plot(inla.barrier.polygon(mesh, barrier.triangles), add=T)
  contour(proj$x, proj$y,inla.mesh.project(proj, latentFieldMAP) ,add = T,labcex  = 1,cex = 1)
